This repo show you how to cut an image up into image tiles and use them as a base for a map.

Basically going from this

![map](resources/map_image_small.jpg)

to a zoomable leaflet map like this:

![map](resources/map_leaflet_1.jpg)
![map](resources/map_leaflet_2.jpg)

Check out the jupyter notebook that show how to do it.

And dive deep in to the functions folder if you need to tweek and tinker.
